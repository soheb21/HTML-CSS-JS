                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                        language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                        the
                        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
                        of
                        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                        extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application,
                        or
                        perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

                    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on
                        the
                        main page about JavaScript.</li>

                    <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                        JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                        checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                        control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>n contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                        runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                        values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based
                        object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited
                        can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special
                        declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                        methods.</p>

                    <h3>Hello world</h3>
                    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                        JavaScript code:</p>
                    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>

                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                        called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                    <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                        characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                        characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                    <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                        Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                        Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
